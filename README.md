# Color_Game_Project
Developed a color game project using HTML5, CSS3 and JS. 

## Working 
1. The color game project was crested to help users get familiar with the concept RGB color coding scheme. 
2. The application works in a way where the user is presented with an RGB value and is asked to find out the block that corresponds to this RGB code. 
3. The user can play in Easy mode which is three blocks only or Hard mode which has six blocks. 
4. If the user is unable to find out in 2 or 5 attempts respectively for easy and hard mode the application will provide the answer at the last attempt. 
5. The user can reset and play again if he wins or loses. There is no limitation to number of games played. 
6. There is no scoring for this game as the purpose is not to compete but explore RGB color coding scheme.
